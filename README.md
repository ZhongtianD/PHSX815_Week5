Homework 6

Numerical_Integration.py computes the numerical integration of a normal distribution between -1 σ to +1 σ. (or a σ to b σ)

At 10 evaluation of the function, Trapezoidal integration error is 0.0016.

While the Gauss–Legendre quadrature method has an error with order 10^(-16). Which is the default precision when print a float number.
